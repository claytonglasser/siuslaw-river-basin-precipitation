#The Challenge
The 773 square mile Siuslaw River Basin is one of the most important natural sites in the United States. More timber has been sourced from the forest contained within this basin over time than any other area of equivalent size in the country. In the early 20th century, the Siuslaw river was the also the richest salmon breeding grounds anywhere in the United States, with local canneries processing as many at 60,000 coho salmon a year. Over time, as the effects of forestry practices have been realized, the salmon population has declined. 

Common forestry practices often result the channelization of streams and the erosion of river banks, which lead to less conducive habitat for salmon. With fewer salmon in the river, less fertility is deposited in the stream and the surrounding area, which leads to less conducive habitat for vegetation, including timber. In effect, poor forest management practices have resulted in both ecological and economic losses. 

Because of the manner in which the stream system and the timber system are intertwined, a model than accounts for the inputs and outputs of both is needed in order to optimize the outcome of either one, let alone both. 

Among the challenges facing anyone who wishes to use this kind of model is access to system-wide information. While it may never be possible to generate a truly complete model of a system like a forest because of its continuity with adjacent systems, forests do often admit of one natural and useful boundary: the drainage basin. Hydrologically, drainage basins constitute relatively coherent and self-contained systems. It is possible to collect and model data about drainage basins completely enough to create a meaningful and accurate insights about its hydrodynamics. 

High-resolution understanding of the movement of water through an ecosystem like the Siuslaw River Basin is important to both restoration ecologists and commercial interests. The following are some its practical applications:

* Information about stream volume levels can be used to determine the appropriate frequency, size, and location of check dams. 
* Information about the intensity and duration of flood events can be used to inform zoning and construction requirements.
* Information about the intensity and duration of precipitation can be used to understand the probable locations of landslides and erosion, and inform preventive measures such as soil stabilization plantings. 

#The Data
In order to acquire insights like those listed above, multiple data sets will be combined and multiple analytic methods will utilized. 

The primary data I plan to use are measurements of precipitation volume. The constituent datasets will be derived from up to 50 sources distributed across the basin, each of which will likely be somewhat different in character. Some sources date back 50 years; some have daily data; others have minute by minute data. They are likely to contain a variety of different data, formats, and conventions, but I think the core of the data will be timestamps and precip volume. Much of this data is freely available, if obscure, through entities such as 

* Bureau of Land Management
* Siuslaw River Basin Watershed Council
* USDA Forest Service

Some of the planned data sources are privately held, but can be retrieved through personal relationships.

Another important data set will be digital elevation models, which can be used in combination with GIS to create topographic visualizations. This information is also freely available, often from the same sources.
